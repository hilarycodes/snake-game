"# snake-game" (Terminal-Based)

## Description
This is a simple Snake game implemented in C#, designed to be played in the terminal. The game follows the classic Snake mechanics where the player controls a growing snake that moves around the screen, consuming food while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score by eating food and growing the snake.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay in a terminal interface.
- Real-time keyboard controls for movement.
- Randomized food spawning mechanics.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows.
